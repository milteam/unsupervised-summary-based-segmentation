0 Good morning. I'm parent of a foreign born U.S citizen child and need to get her a SSN card, could you tell me about it?
0 No problem. To do that, you'll need to prove first the child's citizenship, so you'll have to present some documents, such as certification of report of birth, consular report of birth abroad or U.S passport.
0 I assume you don't have any of these documents?
0 No, i don't, no.
0 Oh, hey, i was wondering if it is possible to present other documents as proof?
0 Sure. In that case, just certain documents are accepted, and these should have child's name, date of birth or age, and a recent photograph, to be acceptable.
1 So, those would be helpful to get that SSN card, isn't?
1 That's correct. Be aware though that any document you present must be originals or copies certified by the agency that issued them. Of course, must be unexpired too.
2 Ok, ok, i get it. But, just to be sure, what about if  i don't have any of these document at hand?
2 You have an option, too. We'll ask you other documents, and as said before, these documents must be unexpired and include key information about you, plus a recent photograph.
2 I don't want to be pesky about this, but, what if i really don't have a document like that at hand?
2 Well, that would be a real extraordinary scenario. Still, we can accept in any case a state issued non driver identification card or even, if that's the case, an adoption decree.
2 But, if i only had the child's certification of report of birth, that could work, right?
2 That's right. A certification of report of birth, aka form DS-1350, should prove to be enough.

After you have been in a page for 25 minutes and not been active on the page you will receive a warning that the page is about to time out, however, you will be able to extend your time on the page. After the third warning on a page you will  have to move to another page.

1 Thank you. Will I be able to start a new session and complete the information if it has not been saved?

4 Who is eligible to  use the estimator?
4 You can use the estimator is you have enough Social Security credits at the time to quality for benefits.
5 Is it possible to estimate my retirement benefits with the estimator?
5 If benefit amount is just an estimate as your earnings may increase or decrease in the future so this is obviously just an estimate.

2 Is there an ultimate time limit?
2 Yes, after the third warning on a page, you must move to another page.
3 Can anyone use the Retirement Estimator?
3 You can use the Retirement Estimator if you have enough Social Security credits at this time to qualify for benefits.
3 And there is no age restriction?
3 If you are age 62 or older and receiving benefits on another Social Security record, you may not use it.

0 Hey, I was wondering how long I can stay on every page of the estimator. It kicked me out before.
0 Of course. Are you aware of security measurements on websites?
0 I've heard about that before, yes.
0 For security reasons, there are time limits for viewing each page. You will receive a warning after 25 minutes without doing anything and you will be able to extend your time on the page.
1 That's what I thought. Still, it is very annoying - I was just coming back from making a tea and found out that your page gave me the boot! By the way, does it matter if I'm currently only receiving Medicare benefits, when I want an estimate?
1 You can still get an estimate in that case.
2 But it is just an estimate, right? I mean, not really reliable numbers.
2 Correct. The Retirement Estimator gives estimates based on your actual Social Security earnings record. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates.
3 So, back to my original issue: how long can I stay on each page before I get booted for being idle?
3 After the third warning on a page, you must move to another page or you'll lose your work on that page.
4 Alright, fair enough. Can you let me know the amount of benefit I am going to get then?
4 Unfortunately we can't provide your actual benefit amount until you apply for benefits. And that amount may differ from the estimates provided because your earnings may increase or decrease in the future.

1 Well, we use your most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. This information is from a tax return filed in 2019 for tax year 2018. Sometimes, the IRS only provides information from a return filed in 2018 for tax year 2017.
2 So if I had less income, what would I need to do? My wife has that issue currently.
2 In that case we need to see documentation verifying the event and the reduction in your income. The documentation you provide should relate to the event and may include a death certificate, a letter from your employer about your retirement, or something similar.

0 Good afternoon. I'm looking for some info about schooling opportunities for veterans. Are there any kind of these benefits?.
0 Sure, there are. These benefits can help you pay your tuition, pick out a school, chose a career and more.
0 That's cool. But, look, i'm a active national guard member. Can i still get access to those benefits?
1 I mean, there would be some kind of alternate method in any case?
1 Sure, no problem. Indeed, you have a choice. You can access benefits through Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty. That would be available if you served for at least 2 years on active duty and you meet all the proper requirements.
1 Oh, really? That sounds terrific, thanks. And what kind of requirements? I suppose all must be verified, isn't?
1 That's correct. May i ask if you were honorably discharged?

1 Good. Now, Do you have a high school diploma a GED or 12 hours of college credit?
1 No, i don't have any of those. That's not good, isn't?

0 Good afternoon. Need some information about avoiding an insurance lapse.
0 For that, you need to keep the address for your vehicle registration and driver license current with the DMV. Plus, you also need to keep liability coverage from a company with license by NYS Department of Financial Services and authorized by the NYS DMV.
0 O.k, thanks. Now, what can you tell me if I happen to not count with a valid auto liability insurance coverage for my vehicle?
0 If you have that situation, you must inmediately surrender your registration and vehicle plates.
1 Umm, that's rough, but i guess is your procedure. Say, someone else can register my vehicle if my registration is suspended, right?
1 Absolutely not. If your intention is to avoid the imposed suspension, the DMV will found that out and will not issue a new registration.
2 What can i do then, in case that happens?
2 Is your registration still valid?
2 No, it already expired.
2 Don't mind me on that last thing. What could happen if i'm already suspended?
2 Then, as said before in other questions, you must surrender your plates to the DMV or pay the optional civil penalty for the entire length of the lapse. Of course, that last thing is in case you are eligible for that.

We will update our records to show that your Temporary Visitor status has been extended so you can renew your license. Your new license will have your new temporary visitor expiration date.
2 Will do. But let me clear one thing up: so, as long as my foreign drivers license isn't expired I can use it to drive in NY?
2 Correct. Your valid foreign driver license allows you to drive without a supervising driver.
2 And if my license is no longer valid and I only have a learner permit, I can't drive without restrictions anymore?
2 Exactly. NY State law requires a supervising driver to ride with you. The supervising driver must be age 21 or over and must have a valid driver license to operate the vehicle that you drive.
3 What a bummer, but no can do. So what if my visitor status is about to get extended?
3 Then you must bring a completed application for permit and a driver license to a DMV office.

4 too late now, so I can do the hearing or the one where I don't have to show up?
4 yes, you may request an in - person DMV hearing or you may request a hearing by affidavit this is a hearing on paper
4 what if I do neither?
4 your registration will be suspended immediately
5 what can I do next time, who do I call to pay?

0 Do you have insurance already?
0 Yeah, in fact, i have one.

3 Oh, oh, another question please. Could you tell me with what purposes you use a document?
3 Well, that would depend on the document presented, but for example we could use your U.S passport as proof of both citizenship and identity.
3 Ok. um, lets say i don't have a document available to present, do i have any options regarding that?
3 Yes, you have an option. We may accept some other document, such as a state issued non driver identification card or, in case your child is adopted, a adoption decree.
4 All right. Please, you told me before that i was limited in times i could replce the SSN card, didn't you?
4 That's correct. You only can go through replacement process 3 times in a year and up to 10 times in your whole life, so better take good care of that card.

0 In that case we would need to see documentation verifying the event and the reduction in your income.
1 I see. So how exactly do you determine my income-related adjustment amounts?
1 Well, we use your most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. This information is from a tax return filed in 2019 for tax year 2018. Sometimes, the IRS only provides information from a return filed in 2018 for tax year 2017.
2 So if I had less income, what would I need to do? My wife has that issue currently.
2 In that case we need to see documentation verifying the event and the reduction in your income. The documentation you provide should relate to the event and may include a death certificate, a letter from your employer about your retirement, or something similar.
