0 Hi there, I am looking for information regarding the Affordable Care Act and my VA health coverage
0 The Affordable Care Act is also known as the health care law. It was created to increase access for citizens to health care coverage, to control health care costs and also to improve health care quality and care coordination
1 If I don't have health insurance, do I have any penalties to pay?
1 This part of the law was changed by Congress, for plans that were starting in 2019. The payment referred to as the individual shared responsibility payment no longer applies in plan year 2019, for which you will be filing taxes in April 2020
2 How do I get health care coverage for 2019 if I am not signed up for VA health care or the Department of Defense health care program?
2 You may still be able to get health care coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Enrolment for this for 2019 is now over however. You can still enrol or change plans if you have had certain life changes or if you qualify for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program CHIP
3 Does my VA health care meet the ACA's minimum essential coverage requirement for 2018?
3 If you were signed up for one of the designated programs listed on the website, your health coverage meets the minimum requirement for 2018
3 What are these designated health care programs?
3 Yes, I am
3 In that case, you don't have to pay any fee when you file your 2018 taxes and to qualify, you must be enrolled on one the programs that are listed on the website
4 Is there a penalty applicable if I don't have health insurance?
4 Until the end of 2018, the ACA required that all US taxpayers had to have health insurance that met a minimum standard. Some taxpayers are eligible for exemptions from this due to certain life events, financial status or other factors. If you had affordable health care options open to you and you chose not to avail of health insurance, then you would have to pay a fee when filing your taxes
4 What happens if I didn't have health coverage in 2018 or have an exemption?
4 In this instance, you may still have to pay a fee to file your taxes in April 2019. To find out more, I will refer you to HealthCare.gov to find out more about exemptions

0 Hello. I'm in the process to making a disability benefits claim. I was told that probably i would have to do some kind of exam, could you tell me about that,please?
0 Have yo already filed you disability claim?
0 Indeeed, i already did that.
0 Excellent. The exam that you was told about is known as compensation and pension exam, or C&P for short. That's a requirement from you to Veterans Affairs.
1 And everybody has to pass through that exam in order to get their claims?
1 Not everyone. That exam is required in case your medical information isn't clear enough to us to decide about your claim.
1 But if i have, well you know, enough information about my condition, I won't be required to do the exam, right?
1 That's correct. In case, your medical profile has enough information, the exam won't be necessary on any instance. That's why your medical information must be as complete as possible.
2 I'm sure i won't need that, but it's good to know what it is. Could you tell me about its ultimate purpose?
2 Through this exam, we'll be capable to determine and rate your disability, based on your disability's severity. That will influence directly on how much you'll receive, and varying between monthly payments and enrollments on veterans health care programs.
3 Wow, that sound very  specific. Lets say i can't go for the exam. I know is better to not miss them, but if its something out of my control, what can you do to help me?

2 And what should I do next, after getting the SOC?
2 You have 60 days or the remainder of the 1-year period following the decision you appealed, whichever is later, to opt in to the modernized system by submitting one of the following forms and checking the SOC/SSOC opt-in box.
3 Let's say I missed the deadline for submitting my request. What should I do then?
3 You could add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim, for example.
4 Alright, makes sense. Can I download the forms on your page?
4 Yes, you can download the forms or learn more about decision review options on our page.

2 Wait, what if my insurance coverage is done by an insurance in Alabama?
2 If your insurance coverage in NY lapses, we will take actions against your New York State registration and driver license even if you move out of New York. This can affect your ability to have a driver license in your new state.
3 Alright, this is interesting. So if I have a car registered in NY, can it be covered by my insurance in Alabama?
3 No, that is not possible.

0 I need to know if I will receive a refund in the event that I fail my I-PIRP course.
0 Have you met all the requirements to complete the course?
0 No, I haven't taken it yet.
1 What about if the course is cancelled by the sponsor? Do I get a refund then?
1 Yes, if the course is cancelled, they must offer you a full refund. In some cases, the sponsor may offer the option of rescheduling the course at a later date.
2 How do you pay for the I-PIRP course?
2 Normally, the sponsor will require you to pay by credit card. However, the payment type will vary by sponsor, so it's best to check with him/her for that information.
3 Okay. Let's go back to my original question. Do I get a refund if I fail the course?
3 No. You will not receive credit for course completion or point and insurance reduction for the course. You may be offered to retake the course for no additional costs, but that is up to the sponsor.
4 What equipment do I need for a DVD ADM course?
4 You will need a tv and a dvd player. If any additional technology is required, the sponsors must provide this for you.
5 How much does a I-PIRP course usually cost?

0 Very well. For starters, those plates has been issued since 2010. And in case you wonder, DMV no longer issues the blue and white types.
1 Well, that's interesting, because i was about to ask what could i do with some old plates of those colors.
1 In that regard, DMV doesn't have any more use for those colors, so if you receive gold plates, don't return the other ones to us. Intead, recyle them according to local procedures.
2 Oh right, oh right. So, how can i get those gold plates?
2 You can proceed in three different ways: By phone, online or at a DMV office. Mail will be used to sent you the separate documents.
2 And that's how ordering works then?

0 Good day. I have received a letter saying that my driver license is suspended and need some guidance with how to react to this.
0 Have you received an order from DMV saying your license or driving privilege is revoked?
0 No, I haven't.
1 Well, I haven't paid a fine for a ticket I got, which led to the suspension. The thing is that I got the ticket outside of NYC and I'm not sure the NYC court is responsible for this. Who do I need to contact?
1 In that case you must contact the local court directly. DMV's My License service can give you additional information about where to pay to a traffic ticket.
1 I understand. Say, is there a way to find out if my license is revoked?
1 Of course. Simply sign up for MyDMV and use the My License, Permit or ID service. A driving privilege is your legal authority to drive in a state other than the state that issued your driver license.
1 Alright. And what if I was suspended for an insurance lapse?
1 In that case you can submit proof of insurance online.
1 Do you have more information, perhaps?
1 For more information, see the section for alcohol or drug related violations on our website.
1 Got that. Just out of curiosity, how could I remove a suspension for the failure of paying child support?
1 To do that you must contact the local child support enforcement agency or the NY State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance OTDA. The OTDA website has a list of local child support enforcement agencies.

1 Have you received a definite suspension?
1 Yes, I have. Hence the questions.
1 In that case it will tell you how long the suspension period will last. You can not drive until the period ends, you pay a termination fee, and have a valid driver license again. You can use DMV's My License, Permit or ID service to check if your license is valid.
2 What if the vehicle is not insured and the registration is still valid?
2 Then you must surrender your registration and plates to DMV.
2 That's great and all, but how can I find out if my license is suspended?

0 I would like to know why secondary schools are missing
1 Does your high school not appear in these data files?
1 is correct does not appear
1 There are usually two main reasons why you may not see your school listed.
2 ok i understand are the same reasons why some districts appear blank on the maps?
2 are different conditions but Districts are listed as missing data only under certain conditions
2 What would those conditions be?
2 I would have to answer the following question:Are you missing the statutory adjusted cohort graduation rate? For example, if districts merged or a new district was created after 2009/10
2 if it is correct we are missing
2 that is why it is shown as missing
3 If Yes, a FAFSA form is submitted but not completed, what does it say?
3 In that case the student will receive an email from the Department of Education asking them to correct the FAFSA form. Email from the Department of Education asking them to correct the FAFSA form. the complete form is very necessary
call_id_637
0 why are the FAFSA completion totals lower than they should be?
1 Would you like to know why the number of FAFSA submissions or completions is lower than you think it should be?
1 no
2 Are you a high school counselor or college access professional and want to know what resources we have to help increase FAFSA completion totals?
2 yes that will help
2 The Federal Student Aid's Financial Aid Toolkit contains federal student aid information and outreach tools for counselors, college access professionals, nonprofit mentors, and others
3 is there a reason why the numbers are so low for older kids at our school?
3 We try to identify students that are likely seniors in high school. Most of the older students would likely not satisfy the age criteria requiring applicants to be less than 20 years of age at the cutoff date when we collect data.
4 why would a district be listed as having insufficient data?
4 Did the district in question merge or is it a new district created after 2009-10 ?
4 it was created after 2010
4 The district would be listed as having insufficient data.
5 ok, also why are numbers different from year to year for the same data on seniors?
5 It probably comes from applicants that had applied in a previous year and weren't listed again

0 That's correct. I have this dependent status. What can I do then?
0 O.k, lets do some check ups first. Are both of your parents in jail?

0 Well, don't worry. That's a special circumstance, so you can submit your FAFSA form without having to submit your parent information.
1 OH, that really is a relief. That information is kind of mandatory for real or foster parents?
1 It is. Whereas you have your real parents or you being adopted, that information is required. But, as said before, there are special circumstances that avoid entirely this requirement.
2 I see. Well, that makes kind of sense, in matter of fact. I suppose is the same if it something like my parents living outside U.S., is that right?
2 Kind of. Is that were your situation, you still should report your parent's information, but selecting the "Foreign Country" Option from the "state of Residence" section in your FAFSA form.
2 Umm, O.k, O.k. I see there is many options then. Look, I guess that required information touches that from taxes, I'm right?

2 Who is my father according to FAFSA if my legal father was never married?
2 answer the questions by placing that parent.
3 Is it possible that I can submit my FAFSA without information from my parents as a dependent student?
3 Yes, but under certain conditions, firstly, are your parents incarcerated?
3 if my parents are in prison

2 Yeah. As said before, she can enjoy a benefit is she's 62 and you're already receiving a retirement or disability benefit, plus be able to qualify for medicare at 65.
3 Thanks, i just wanted to be sure. Oh, and how much will my spouse receive, given my benefit is higher, please?
3 If you have a higher benefit, your spouse will get an extra amount on your record. In that way. the combination of benefits equals that higher amount.
3 I see, i see, interesting thing. A last question, please. What happens if my spouse begin to receive benefits? There will be some effect?
3 Well, the immediate effect would be that the benefit amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to her full retirement age. That applies if she begins to receive benefits between age 62 and her full retirement age.
